    <h1>History</h1>
    <p style="background-color: rgb(202, 204, 57, 75%); margin-left: 510px; margin-bottom: 30px; margin-right: 20px;padding: 5px 5px;">Pliny’s Pickles is located out of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania and was started by Alexander Fogelman.
        Fogelman emigrated from Poland to the United States during the mid 19th century and then began Pliny’s
        out of the cellar of his small New York home. The idea came about during a lunch break at the mill
        Alexander worked at. Everyday Alexander would bring one kosher dill pickle to accompany his bland
        bread-and-potato diet, and on this particular day a co-worker asked for a bite of his slimy cucumber.
        Alexander obliged, and to his surprise the man ate the entire pickle. His co-worker couldn’t get enough,
        Alexander’s pickle was the best thing to relish his taste buds in years. “I want one of these every day from
        now on,” exclaimed the man. Alexander agreed to bring a pickle for the man every day for a small price.
        Quickly word spread around the mill of Alexander's delicious pickles, and soon he was making money
        hand over fist. He eventually had a steady income from his pickle endeavors and quit his job at the mill.
        With that Alexander established his pickle empire, Pliny’s Pickles.</p>
